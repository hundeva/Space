Notes
-----

Some private information has been removed, such as:
- google services configuration files (google-services.json)
- signing keystores (debug-key.jks)

- YouTube API key
- AdMob ids

If you intend to build the project, you might will need to:
- provide your own google services configuration, or remove the google services plugin
- create your own signing keystores
- get your own NASA API key, or use DEMO_KEY
- get a YouTube API key, or YouTube will fail
- get your own AdMob ids, though you shouldn't really re-release this project anywhere
